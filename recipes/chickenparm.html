    Chicken parmesan, or chicken parmigiana, is a dish that consists of breaded
    chicken breast covered in tomato sauce and mozzarella, parmesan, or
    provolone cheese. A quantity of ham or bacon is sometimes added. The dish
    originated in the Italian diaspora in the United States during the early
    20th century.

      <h2>Steps to making Chicken Parmesan</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
          Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable
          freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound
          chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of
          1/2-inch.
        </li>
        <li>
          Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or
          strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both
          sides
        </li>
        <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>
          Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set
          aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to
          the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for
          each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until
          it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about
          2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons
          tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of
          mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle
          remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive
          oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and
          chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An
          instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
          165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
